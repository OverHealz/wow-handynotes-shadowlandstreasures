# Changelog

## Changed in v8

* Improved the data for Bastion and Maldraxxus
* Better display when treasures aren't currently available, though data is very incomplete as to which ones do (because it's difficult to tell without visiting them all... and it might turn out to *really* be "are you in any covenant?" and I need 
to get a leveling character to the right point to test this)
    * By default unavailable mobs/treasures will still show up, but tinted red. If this is very annoying, there's a setting for it in the options

## Changed in v7

* Add Chaotic Riftstones to the Maw
* Fix check that was stopping collected jellycats from being hidden before you'd completed the entire Nine Afterlives achievement

## Changed in v6

* Add achievement: Nine Afterlives (the jellycats)
* Flag Bastion Abandoned Stockpile as being max-level, and highlight its entrance.
* Fix the Larion Tamer's Harness location and loot
* Explain the Corrupted Clawguard better
* Make path-to-treasure nodes display on the minimap automatically
* Cache loot when opening the zone map, so there's less "loading..."
* Change the default point icon to the blizzard default chest vignette icon (which looks way better than it did in the last expansion)
* Add some config for setting a default icon, if you'd prefer something different

## Changed in v5

* Update loot and some spawn locations
